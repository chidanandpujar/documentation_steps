? Please choose the default image you want to use with act:
  - Large size image: ca. 17GB download + 53.1GB storage, you will need 75GB of free disk space, snapshots of GitHub Hosted Runners without snap and pulled docker images
  - Medium size image: ~500MB, includes only necessary tools to bootstrap actions and aims to be compatible with most actions
  - Micro size image: <200MB, contains only NodeJS required to bootstrap actions, doesn't work with all actions

Default image and other options can be changed manually in /root/.config/act/actrc (please refer to https://nektosact.com/usage/index.html?highlight=configur#configuration-file for additional information about file structure) Medium
